# MatJuice version 2

One we have all the built-in functions that MatJuice
supports we can modified the MatJuice compile
slightly to provide the compiler
with the "heavy-lifting" done by 
WebAssembly.
For what is actually left in these regard is continue implementing built-ins. Then modifying Matjuice
slightly to use the WebAssembly functions instead.
