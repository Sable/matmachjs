# Ideas
- **Assertions**: Create assertions but make own command line tool to remove them at compile time.


# Sources of innefficiencies
- Scalars: Possible optimization, convert to registers (local variables), if they ask for information reach into memory
- Other linear algebra operations that when combine yield a better estimate.
